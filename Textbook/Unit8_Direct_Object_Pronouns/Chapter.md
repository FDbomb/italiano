# Unit 8: Direct Object Pronouns (I Pronomi Diretti)

## Objective

In this unit, you will learn how to avoid repetition and make your sentences flow more naturally by using **direct object pronouns**. These are the words we use to replace a noun that is the direct object of a verb, equivalent to "it," "him," "her," and "them" in English.

## 1. What is a Direct Object Pronoun?

A direct object is the person or thing that directly receives the action of the verb. It answers the question "What?" or "Whom?"

*   Vedo **Marco**. (I see **Marco**.) -> Whom do I see? Marco.
*   Compro **la mela**. (I buy **the apple**.) -> What do I buy? The apple.

A direct object pronoun is a word that replaces this noun.

*   Vedo Marco. -> **Lo** vedo. (I see **him**.)
*   Compro la mela. -> **La** compro. (I buy **it**.)

Using these pronouns is essential for sounding natural. It's like saying "I bought the book and read it" instead of "I bought the book and read the book."

## 2. Forms and Placement

The pronouns are simple, but their placement is key.

| Pronoun | Replaces                               | English |
| :------ | :------------------------------------- | :------ |
| **mi**  | me (me)                                | me      |
| **ti**  | te (you)                               | you     |
| **lo**  | masculine singular noun (e.g., il libro) | him, it |
| **la**  | feminine singular noun (e.g., la mela) | her, it |
| **ci**  | noi (us)                               | us      |
| **vi**  | voi (you plural)                       | you     |
| **li**  | masculine plural noun (e.g., i libri)  | them    |
| **le**  | feminine plural noun (e.g., le mele)   | them    |

**Placement Rule:** The pronoun is placed **directly before the conjugated verb**.

*   *Guardi la televisione?* -> *Sì, **la** guardo.* (Yes, I watch it.)
*   *Mangi gli spinaci?* -> *No, non **li** mangio.* (No, I don't eat them.)
*   *Marco **ci** ha visti al supermercato.* (Marco saw us at the supermarket.)

**With `l'`:** Before a vowel or the letter `h`, `lo` and `la` contract to **`l'`**.
*   *Hai visto l'ultimo film?* -> *Sì, **l'**ho visto.*
*   *Hai comprato l'aranciata?* -> *Sì, **l'**ho comprata.*

## 3. Pronouns in the Passato Prossimo

This is the most complex part. When you use a direct object pronoun with the *passato prossimo*, a special rule applies.

**The Golden Rule:** When a third-person direct object pronoun (`lo`, `la`, `l'`, `li`, `le`) comes before `avere`, the **past participle must agree in gender and number with the pronoun**.

Let's break it down:

1.  *Hai comprato **il pane**?* (Did you buy the bread?)
    *   *Sì, **l'**ho comprat**o**.* (Yes, I bought it.) - `l'` stands for `lo` (il pane), so the participle ends in `-o`.

2.  *Hai comprato **la pasta**?* (Did you buy the pasta?)
    *   *Sì, **l'**ho comprat**a**.* (Yes, I bought it.) - `l'` stands for `la` (la pasta), so the participle ends in `-a`.

3.  *Hai comprato **i pomodori**?* (Did you buy the tomatoes?)
    *   *Sì, **li** ho comprat**i**.* (Yes, I bought them.) - `li` is masculine plural, so the participle ends in `-i`.

4.  *Hai comprato **le carote**?* (Did you buy the carrots?)
    *   *Sì, **le** ho comprat**e**.* (Yes, I bought them.) - `le` is feminine plural, so the participle ends in `-e`.

**Note:** This agreement rule only applies to the third-person pronouns (`lo, la, li, le`). With `mi, ti, ci, vi`, the agreement is optional and usually not done in modern Italian.
*   *Marco, Maria **ti ha visto**.* (Marco, Maria saw you.) - `visto` is standard.

## 4. Pronouns with Modal Verbs

With modal verbs (*dovere, potere, volere*) followed by an infinitive, you have two choices for placement:

1.  **Before the modal verb:**
    *   ***La** devo comprare.* (I have to buy it.)
2.  **Attached to the end of the infinitive:** (drop the `-e` of the infinitive)
    *   *Devo comprar**la**.* (I have to buy it.)

Both are correct and widely used.

*   *Puoi aiutarmi?* / *Mi puoi aiutare?* (Can you help me?)
*   *Voglio vederli.* / *Li voglio vedere.* (I want to see them.)
