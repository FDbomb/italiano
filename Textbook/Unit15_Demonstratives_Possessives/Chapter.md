# Unit 15: Demonstrative Adjectives and Pronouns & Review of Possessives

## Objective

In this unit, you will learn to point out specific items or people using demonstrative adjectives and pronouns. This will allow you to specify *which* item you are referring to. You will also reinforce your understanding of possessive adjectives and pronouns, contrasting them with demonstratives to clearly indicate ownership or belonging.

## 1. Demonstrative Adjectives (Aggettivi Dimostrativi)

### What are they and WHY do they exist?

Demonstrative adjectives are words like "this," "that," "these," and "those" in English. Their purpose is to **point out** a specific noun, indicating its position relative to the speaker (and sometimes the listener). In Italian, the most common demonstrative adjectives are `questo` (this/these) and `quello` (that/those).

### 1.1 Questo (This / These)

`Questo` is used for things or people that are **near** the speaker. Think of it as pointing to something you can easily touch or that is very close to you.

**How to Form It:** Like all Italian adjectives, `questo` must **agree in gender and number** with the noun it modifies. This is a fundamental rule in Italian grammar.

| Form        | Meaning     | Example                               |
| :---------- | :---------- | :------------------------------------ |
| **questo**  | this (m.s.) | *Questo libro è interessante.* (This book is interesting.) |
| **questa**  | this (f.s.) | *Questa casa è grande.* (This house is big.) |
| **questi**  | these (m.pl.)| *Questi ragazzi sono simpatici.* (These boys are friendly.) |
| **queste**  | these (f.pl.)| *Queste penne sono mie.* (These pens are mine.) |

### 1.2 Quello (That / Those)

`Quello` is used for things or people that are **far** from the speaker (and often the listener). Think of it as pointing to something across the room or further away.

**How to Form It: This is the tricky part for English speakers!** `Quello` is irregular and behaves very much like the definite article `il` (and its variations `lo`, `l'`, `i`, `gli`, `la`, `le`). Its form changes depending on the first letter(s) of the noun it precedes, just like the definite articles do. This is why it has so many variations.

| Form        | Meaning     | Rule (like definite article) | Example                               |
| :---------- | :---------- | :--------------------------- | :------------------------------------ |
| **quel**    | that (m.s.) | before consonant             | *Quel ragazzo è alto.* (That boy is tall.) |
| **quello**  | that (m.s.) | before s+consonant, z, gn, ps, x, y | *Quello studente è bravo.* (That student is good.) |
| **quell'**  | that (m.s.) | before vowel                 | *Quell'albero è vecchio.* (That tree is old.) |
| **quei**    | those (m.pl.)| before consonant             | *Quei libri sono vecchi.* (Those books are old.) |
| **quegli**  | those (m.pl.)| before s+consonant, z, gn, ps, x, y, vowel | *Quegli studenti sono bravi.* (Those students are good.) |
| **quella**  | that (f.s.) | before consonant             | *Quella ragazza è simpatica.* (That girl is friendly.) |
| **quell'**  | that (f.s.) | before vowel                 | *Quell'amica è italiana.* (That friend is Italian.) |
| **quelle**  | those (f.pl.)| before consonant             | *Quelle case sono belle.* (Those houses are beautiful.) |

## 2. Demonstrative Pronouns (Pronomi Dimostrativi)

### What are they and WHY do they exist?

Demonstrative pronouns replace a noun that has already been mentioned or is clear from context, and they still point out a specific item or person. They save you from repeating the noun. In English, we use "this one," "that one," "these," "those." In Italian, the forms are exactly the same as the demonstrative adjectives.

*   *Questo è il mio libro.* (This is my book.) - Here, `Questo` is a pronoun, replacing "this thing."
*   *Quale preferisci? Questo o quello?* (Which one do you prefer? This one or that one?) - `Questo` and `quello` replace "this one" and "that one."
*   *Non voglio queste scarpe, voglio quelle.* (I don't want these shoes, I want those.) - `queste` and `quelle` replace "these ones" and "those ones."

## 3. Review of Possessive Adjectives and Pronouns

### What are they and WHY is their agreement different from English?

Possessive adjectives and pronouns indicate ownership or belonging (e.g., "my," "your," "his," "mine," "yours"). The most important rule to remember, and a key difference from English, is that they **agree in gender and number with the THING POSSESSED, not the possessor.**

For example, in English, "his car" and "his book" both use "his." In Italian, it would be `la sua macchina` (because `macchina` is feminine) and `il suo libro` (because `libro` is masculine). The form of `suo/sua` changes to match the noun it describes, not the gender of the owner.

### 3.1 Possessive Adjectives (Aggettivi Possessivi)

Possessive adjectives always precede the noun they modify, usually with a definite article.

| Owner     | Masc. Sing. | Fem. Sing. | Masc. Plural | Fem. Plural |
| :-------- | :---------- | :--------- | :----------- | :---------- |
| io (my)   | il **mio**  | la **mia** | i **miei**   | le **mie**  |
| tu (your) | il **tuo**  | la **tua** | i **tuoi**   | le **tue**  |
| lui/lei (his/her) | il **suo**  | la **sua** | i **suoi**   | le **sue**  |
| noi (our) | il **nostro**| la **nostra**| i **nostri** | le **nostre**|
| voi (your pl.)| il **vostro**| la **vostra**| i **vostri** | le **vostre**|
| loro (their)| il **loro** | la **loro**| i **loro**   | le **loro** |

**The Family Member Exception: WHY is the article dropped?**

For **singular, unmodified family members**, you **drop the definite article** (`il`, `la`, etc.). This is a unique rule in Italian, often thought to reflect the close, inherent relationship within a family, making the article unnecessary.

*   `mio padre` (my father)
*   `tua madre` (your mother)
*   `suo fratello` (his/her brother)

**BUT, you MUST USE the article when:**

1.  The family member is **PLURAL**: `i miei fratelli`, `le tue sorelle`
2.  The family member is **MODIFIED** (e.g., with an adjective): `il mio fratello minore` (my younger brother)
3.  The possessive is **LORO** (Loro is the exception to the exception!): `il loro padre`, `la loro madre`
4.  With affectionate/diminutive terms: `la mia mamma`, `il mio papà`

### 3.2 Possessive Pronouns (Pronomi Possessivi)

Possessive pronouns replace a noun and indicate ownership (e.g., "mine," "yours"). They have the same forms as possessive adjectives, always preceded by the definite article.

*   *Questo libro è il mio.* (This book is mine.)
*   *La tua macchina è rossa, la mia è blu.* (Your car is red, mine is blue.)

## 4. Contrasting Demonstratives and Possessives

### WHY is it important to distinguish them?

It's crucial to understand the distinct roles of demonstratives and possessives to avoid confusion and to express yourself precisely:

*   **Demonstratives** point out *which* specific item (this one, that one). They answer the question "Which one?"
    *   *Prendo **questo** caffè.* (I'll take this coffee.)
    *   *Mi piace **quella** borsa.* (I like that bag.)

*   **Possessives** indicate *whose* item it is. They answer the question "Whose?"
    *   *Questo è **il mio** caffè.* (This is my coffee.)
    *   *È **la sua** borsa.* (It's her bag.)

They can also be used together to provide even more specific information:

*   ***Questo** è **il mio** libro.* (This is my book.) - Pointing out *this* specific item, and stating it belongs to *me*.
*   *Non voglio **quelle** tue scarpe.* (I don't want those shoes of yours.) - Pointing out *those* specific shoes, and stating they belong to *you*.
