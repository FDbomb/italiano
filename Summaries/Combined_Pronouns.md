# Grammar Summary: Combined Pronouns (Pronomi Combinati)

Combined pronouns are used to say "it to me," "them to you," etc., in a single unit. They are formed when an **indirect pronoun** is followed by a **direct pronoun**.

**Placement:** Before the conjugated verb, or attached to an infinitive.

## Formation Rules

1.  The indirect pronouns `mi, ti, ci, vi` change their vowel to **`e`**. (`me, te, ce, ve`)
2.  The indirect pronouns `gli` (to him) and `le` (to her) combine with the direct pronoun to form a single word starting with **`glie-`**. This form is used for both masculine and feminine.
