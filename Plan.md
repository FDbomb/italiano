# Italian Learning Plan

## Objective

To advance my A1-level Italian by following a structured learning plan that uses a traditional textbook and worksheet methodology. The plan should build upon my existing knowledge of basic grammar (gender, noun endings, basic verb conjugations) and vocabulary (family, travel, food, clothes).

## Requirements

1.  **Comprehensive Learning Plan:** A step-by-step curriculum that introduces new grammatical concepts and vocabulary in a logical order.
2.  **Textbook-Style Resources:** For each step in the plan, provide "chapters" that explain concepts, provide vocabulary lists, and include corresponding worksheets for practice.
3.  **One-Page Grammar Summaries:** A series of separate, concise reference documents, each dedicated to a single core grammatical concept (e.g., Present Tense, Passato Prossimo, Noun-Adjective Agreement, Possessives).

## My Plan

1.  **Propose a Curriculum:** I will first outline a multi-unit curriculum, starting from the user's current knowledge base and progressing through key A1/A2 topics. Each unit will focus on a specific theme (e.g., "Daily Routines," "Talking About the Past").
2.  **Generate Unit Materials:** Once the curriculum is approved, I will begin generating the materials for each unit, one by one. For each unit, I will provide three files:
    -   A **Chapter** file containing grammar explanations and a vocabulary list.
    -   A **Worksheet** file with practical exercises.
    -   An **Answer Key** file for the worksheet.
3.  **Generate Grammar Summaries:** Alongside the curriculum, I will create the one-page summary documents requested. These will be clearly named and formatted for quick reference.

## Structure

### Unit Structure

Each regular unit follows a consistent pattern:

-   Chapter.md:

    -   Objective: A brief paragraph (1-2 sentences) outlining the unit's goals.
    -   Grammar Sections: Typically 2-3 main grammar topics.
        -   Each topic has a clear heading (## 1. Topic Name).
        -   Subheadings for explanation (### What are they and WHY do they exist?), formation (### How
            to Form Them), and common usage/irregularities.
        -   Includes tables for conjugations, pronouns, or article combinations.
        -   Numerous examples with English translations.
    -   Expanded Vocabulary List: Categorized vocabulary relevant to the unit's theme.

-   Worksheet.md:

    -   Title: # Unit X Worksheet (Revised): [Unit Title]
    -   Exercises:
        -   Number of Exercises: 5-6 exercises per unit.
        -   Exercise Types: Each exercise focuses on one of the grammar points introduced in the
            Chapter.md, or combines them. Common types include:
            -   Fill-in-the-blanks (conjugations, articles, prepositions, pronouns).
            -   Answering questions.
            -   Sentence transformation (e.g., changing tense, singular to plural).
            -   Dialogue completion.
            -   Translation (English to Italian).
            -   Spot the error.
        -   Challenge Exercises: The last 1-2 exercises are often marked as "Challenge" and require
            combining multiple concepts or open-ended responses (e.g., short paragraph writing,
            dialogue creation).
        -   Number of Questions per Exercise:
            -   Fill-in-the-blanks: 8-10 questions.
            -   Sentence transformation: 4-6 questions.
            -   Translation: 5-6 sentences.
            -   Dialogue/Open-ended: 1-2 prompts.

-   AnswerKey.md:
    -   Mirrors the Worksheet.md structure exactly, providing the correct answers for each exercise.

### Review Unit Structure

Review units are more extensive and cover concepts from previous units.

-   Worksheet.md (Review):

    -   Title: # Unit X Worksheet (Expanded): Comprehensive Review (Units Y-Z)
    -   Number of Exercises: Unit 6 has 15 main exercises, plus 2 "Challenge Sections" with multiple
        sub-challenges.
    -   Exercise Types: A broader mix, designed to test cumulative knowledge. Examples from Unit 6
        include:
        -   Verb Conjugation Medley (mixing tenses from different units).
        -   Nouns, Articles, and Prepositions (combining various article and preposition types).
        -   Sentence Transformation (across multiple tenses).
        -   Spot the Error (covering common mistakes from all reviewed units).
        -   Dialogue Completion.
        -   Comprehensive Translation.
        -   Open-Ended Paragraph.
        -   Specific drills for concepts.
        -   Challenge Sections: These are more complex, including paragraph translations, reported
            speech, combining pronouns/imperatives, tricky auxiliary verb choices, and
            singular-to-plural transformations. There's also an open-ended creative writing prompt.
    -   Number of Questions per Exercise: Varies widely, from 5-10 for specific drills to longer
        prompts for translations and creative writing.

-   AnswerKey.md (Review):
    -   Mirrors the Worksheet.md structure, providing answers and including "Review Notes" to
        indicate which concepts are being tested for each question.
