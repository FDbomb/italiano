# Unit 9: Indirect Object Pronouns (I Pronomi Indiretti)

## Objective

After mastering direct object pronouns, we now turn to their counterpart: **indirect object pronouns**. These pronouns answer the question "To whom?" or "For whom?" an action is done. They correspond to English phrases like "to me," "to him," "for her," etc., and are crucial for talking about communication and giving things.

## 1. What is an Indirect Object Pronoun?

While a direct object directly receives the action (I see **the book**), an indirect object is the recipient or beneficiary of the action. It is almost always introduced by the preposition **`a`** (to) in Italian.

*   Scrivo **a Maria**. (I write **to Maria**.) -> To whom do I write? To Maria.
*   Telefono **a mia madre**. (I call **my mother**.) -> To whom do I call? To my mother.
*   Do un regalo **a te**. (I give a gift **to you**.) -> To whom do I give a gift? To you.

An indirect object pronoun replaces this `a + person` phrase.

*   Scrivo a Maria. -> **Le** scrivo. (I write **to her**.)
*   Telefono a mia madre. -> **Le** telefono. (I call **her**.)
*   Do un regalo a te. -> **Ti** do un regalo. (I give a gift **to you**.)

## 2. Forms and Placement

Many of the forms are identical to the direct object pronouns, but the third person is different. This is the most important distinction to learn.

| Pronoun | Replaces             | English         |
| :------ | :------------------- | :-------------- |
| **mi**  | a me (to me)         | (to/for) me     |
| **ti**  | a te (to you)        | (to/for) you    |
| **gli** | a lui (to him)       | (to/for) him    |
| **le**  | a lei (to her)       | (to/for) her    |
| **Le**  | a Lei (to you, formal)| (to/for) you    |
| **ci**  | a noi (to us)        | (to/for) us     |
| **vi**  | a voi (to you pl.)   | (to/for) you    |
| **gli** | a loro (to them)     | (to/for) them   |

**Key Differences from Direct Pronouns:**
*   **`gli`** means "to him."
*   **`le`** means "to her."
*   **`gli`** ALSO means "to them." In formal writing, you might see `loro` placed *after* the verb (e.g., *Do loro un libro*), but in modern spoken Italian, `gli` is used for both "to him" and "to them."

**Placement:** Just like direct object pronouns, they are placed **directly before the conjugated verb**.

*   ***Mi** piace la musica.* (Music is pleasing **to me**.) - The classic example!
*   ***Ti** scrivo un'email piÃ¹ tardi.* (I'll write an email **to you** later.)
*   *Cosa **gli** hai detto?* (What did you say **to him**?)
*   ***Le** telefono ogni giorno.* (I call her every day.)

## 3. Pronouns in the Passato Prossimo

This is much simpler than with direct object pronouns.

**The Rule:** The past participle **NEVER** agrees with an indirect object pronoun.

*   *Ho parlato a Marco.* -> **Gli** ho parlat**o**.
*   *Ho parlato a Maria.* -> **Le** ho parlat**o**.
*   *Ho parlato ai miei amici.* -> **Gli** ho parlat**o**.

The past participle remains in the default `-o` form because there is no direct object for it to agree with.
