# Italian Learning Plan

## Objective

To advance my A1-level Italian by following a structured learning plan that uses a traditional textbook and worksheet methodology. The plan should build upon my existing knowledge of basic grammar (gender, noun endings, basic verb conjugations) and vocabulary (family, travel, food, clothes).

## Requirements

1.  **Comprehensive Learning Plan:** A step-by-step curriculum that introduces new grammatical concepts and vocabulary in a logical order.
2.  **Textbook-Style Resources:** For each step in the plan, provide "chapters" that explain concepts, provide vocabulary lists, and include corresponding worksheets for practice.
3.  **One-Page Grammar Summaries:** A series of separate, concise reference documents, each dedicated to a single core grammatical concept (e.g., Present Tense, Passato Prossimo, Noun-Adjective Agreement, Possessives).

## My Plan

1.  **Propose a Curriculum:** I will first outline a multi-unit curriculum, starting from the user's current knowledge base and progressing through key A1/A2 topics. Each unit will focus on a specific theme (e.g., "Daily Routines," "Talking About the Past").
2.  **Generate Unit Materials:** Once the curriculum is approved, I will begin generating the materials for each unit, one by one. For each unit, I will provide three files:
    *   A **Chapter** file containing grammar explanations and a vocabulary list.
    *   A **Worksheet** file with practical exercises.
    *   An **Answer Key** file for the worksheet.
3.  **Generate Grammar Summaries:** Alongside the curriculum, I will create the one-page summary documents requested. These will be clearly named and formatted for quick reference.
