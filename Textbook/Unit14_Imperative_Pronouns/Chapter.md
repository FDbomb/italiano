# Unit 14: The Imperative (Formal and Plural) & Pronoun Attachment

## Objective

In this unit, you will learn how to give commands, instructions, and advice in formal situations and to groups of people. You will also master how to attach pronouns to imperative verbs, making your commands more precise and natural.

## 1. The Imperative Mood: What, Why, and How

### What is it and WHY does it exist?

The imperative mood is used to give direct commands, instructions, advice, or make requests. In English, we simply use the base form of the verb (e.g., "Go!", "Eat!"). Italian, however, has specific verb forms for the imperative, which change depending on who you are addressing (you singular informal, you singular formal, you plural informal, you plural formal, or even "let's").

Mastering the imperative is crucial for everyday interactions, from ordering food in a restaurant to following a recipe, or giving directions.

### Review: Informal Singular Imperative (`tu`)

As a quick recap from Unit 2, the informal `tu` imperative is used with friends, family, and people you know well. Its formation varies slightly:
*   **-are verbs:** Use the `lui/lei` form of the present indicative (e.g., `parlare` -> `parla!`).
*   **-ere/-ire verbs:** Use the `tu` form of the present indicative (e.g., `prendere` -> `prendi!`, `finire` -> `finisci!`).
*   **Irregular `tu` forms:** `sii`, `abbi`, `va'`, `da'`, `di'`, `fa'`, `sta'`.

## 2. The Formal Imperative (`Lei`)

### What is it and WHY is it formed this way?

When addressing someone formally (using `Lei`, the polite singular "you"), the imperative is formed using the **third person singular of the present subjunctive**. This might seem strange to an English speaker, as the subjunctive is often associated with wishes or doubts. However, in Italian, using the subjunctive for formal commands is a historical convention that conveys politeness and respect. It's a fixed grammatical rule you need to learn.

| Verb Type | Infinitive | Present Subjunctive (Lei) | Imperative (Lei) | Example                                  |
| :-------- | :--------- | :------------------------ | :--------------- | :--------------------------------------- |
| -are      | parlare    | (che Lei) parli           | **Parli!**       | *Parli più lentamente, per favore.* (Speak more slowly, please.) |
| -ere      | prendere  | (che Lei) prenda          | **Prenda!**      | *Prenda un caffè.* (Have a coffee.)      |
| -ire      | finire     | (che Lei) finisca         | **Finisca!**     | *Finisca il lavoro.* (Finish the work.)  |

### Irregular Formal Imperatives

Many common verbs have irregular forms in the present subjunctive, which then carry over to the formal imperative. These are important to memorize as they are frequently used.

| Infinitive | Imperative (Lei) | Example                                  |
| :--------- | :--------------- | :--------------------------------------- |
| essere     | **sia**          | *Sia paziente!* (Be patient!)            |
| avere      | **abbia**        | *Abbia fiducia!* (Have faith!)           |
| andare     | **vada**         | *Vada dritto!* (Go straight!)            |
| dare       | **dia**          | *Mi dia il libro.* (Give me the book.)   |
| dire       | **dica**         | *Dica la verità.* (Tell the truth.)      |
| fare       | **faccia**       | *Faccia attenzione!* (Pay attention!)    |
| stare      | **stia**         | *Stia bene!* (Be well!)                  |
| venire     | **venga**        | *Venga qui!* (Come here!)                |

### Negative Formal Imperative

To make a formal command negative, simply place `non` before the imperative verb. This is straightforward.

*   *Non **parli**!* (Don't speak!)
*   *Non **vada** via!* (Don't go away!)

## 3. The Plural Imperative (`Voi` and `Loro`)

### 3.1 Informal Plural Imperative (`Voi`)

When addressing a group informally (using `voi`), the imperative is formed using the **second person plural of the present indicative**. This is good news, as it means you already know these forms!

| Verb Type | Infinitive | Present Indicative (voi) | Imperative (voi) | Example                                  |
| :-------- | :--------- | :----------------------- | :--------------- | :--------------------------------------- |
| -are      | parlare    | (voi) parlate            | **Parlate!**     | *Parlate più lentamente, per favore.* (Speak more slowly, please.) |
| -ere      | prendere  | (voi) prendete           | **Prendete!**    | *Prendete un caffè.* (Have a coffee.)      |
| -ire      | finire     | (voi) finite             | **Finite!**      | *Finite il lavoro.* (Finish the work.)  |

**Irregular `voi` Imperatives:** These are the same as their present indicative forms.

*   *Siate pazienti!* (Be patient!)
*   *Andate via!* (Go away!)

### 3.2 Formal Plural Imperative (`Loro`)

When addressing a group formally (using `Loro`), the imperative is formed using the **third person plural of the present subjunctive**. Similar to the formal singular `Lei` imperative, this maintains a level of politeness and formality when addressing multiple people you don't know well or want to show respect to.

| Verb Type | Infinitive | Present Subjunctive (Loro) | Imperative (Loro) | Example                                  |
| :-------- | :--------- | :------------------------- | :--------------- | :--------------------------------------- |
| -are      | parlare    | (che Loro) parlino         | **Parlino!**     | *Parlino più lentamente, per favore.* (Speak more slowly, please.) |
| -ere      | prendere  | (che Loro) prendano        | **Prendano!**    | *Prendano un caffè.* (Have a coffee.)      |
| -ire      | finire     | (che Loro) finiscano       | **Finiscano!**   | *Finiscano il lavoro.* (Finish the work.)  |

**Irregular `Loro` Imperatives:** These are the same as their present subjunctive forms.

*   *Siano pazienti!* (Be patient!)
*   *Vadano via!* (Go away!)

### Negative Plural Imperative

To make a plural command negative, simply place `non` before the imperative verb.

*   *Non **parlate**!* (Don't speak! - voi)
*   *Non **vadano** via!* (Don't go away! - Loro)

## 4. Pronoun Attachment with the Imperative

### What is it and WHY is it important?

When you use pronouns (direct, indirect, reflexive, or combined) with imperative verbs, their placement changes depending on the imperative form. This is a key difference from English, where pronouns always precede the verb (e.g., "Give *me* the book"). In Italian, sometimes they attach to the end, forming a single word, and sometimes they precede the verb. This rule is crucial for sounding natural and grammatically correct.

### 4.1 `tu`, `noi`, and `voi` Imperatives: Pronouns ATTACH!

For the informal singular (`tu`), and both plural forms (`noi` and `voi`), pronouns are **attached to the end** of the imperative verb, forming a single word. The final vowel of the imperative verb is often dropped before attachment to make pronunciation smoother.

*   **`tu` form:**
    *   *Parla!* (Speak!) + *mi* (to me) &rarr; *Parlami!* (Speak to me!)
    *   *Prendi!* (Take!) + *lo* (it) &rarr; *Prendilo!* (Take it!)
    *   *Fa'!* (Do!) + *lo* (it) &rarr; *Fallo!* (Do it!) - Note: The apostrophe is often doubled for monosyllabic irregulars (`fa'`, `di'`, `va'`, `da'`, `sta'`) when a pronoun attaches, to preserve the original stress.
    *   *Alzati!* (Get up!) + *ti* (yourself) &rarr; *Alzati!* (Get up!)

*   **`noi` form:**
    *   *Parliamo!* (Let's speak!) + *ci* (to us) &rarr; *Parliamoci!* (Let's speak to each other!)
    *   *Prendiamo!* (Let's take!) + *li* (them) &rarr; *Prendiamoli!* (Let's take them!)

*   **`voi` form:**
    *   *Parlate!* (Speak!) + *mi* (to me) &rarr; *Parlatemi!* (Speak to me!)
    *   *Prendete!* (Take!) + *lo* (it) &rarr; *Prendetelo!* (Take it!)
    *   *Alzatevi!* (Get up!) + *vi* (yourselves) &rarr; *Alzatevi!* (Get up!)

### 4.2 `Lei` and `Loro` Imperatives: Pronouns PRECEDE!

For the formal singular (`Lei`) and formal plural (`Loro`) imperatives, pronouns are placed **before** the imperative verb, as separate words. This is similar to how pronouns are placed with conjugated verbs in other tenses.

*   **`Lei` form:**
    *   *Mi parli!* (Speak to me!)
    *   *Lo prenda!* (Take it!)
    *   *Si alzi!* (Get up!)

*   **`Loro` form:**
    *   *Ci parlino!* (Speak to us!)
    *   *Li prendano!* (Take them!)
    *   *Si alzino!* (Get up!)

### 4.3 Combined Pronouns with Imperative

When using combined pronouns (e.g., *me lo, te la*), the same rules for attachment/precedence apply. Remember the order of combined pronouns: Indirect Object Pronoun comes first, then Direct Object Pronoun.

*   **`tu`, `noi`, `voi`:** Pronouns are attached.
    *   *Dammi!* (Give me!) + *lo* (it) &rarr; *Dammelo!* (Give it to me!)
    *   *Portateci!* (Bring us!) + *li* (them) &rarr; *Portateceli!* (Bring them to us!)

*   **`Lei`, `Loro`:** Pronouns come before the verb.
    *   *Me lo dia!* (Give it to me!)
    *   *Ce li portino!* (Bring them to us!)
