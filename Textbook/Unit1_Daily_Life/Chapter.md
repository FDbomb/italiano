# Unit 1 (Revised): La Vita Quotidiana (Daily Life)

## Objective

In this unit, you will learn to describe your daily routine in detail. We will explore three core concepts: reflexive verbs (actions you do to yourself), telling time with precision, and adverbs of frequency (how often you do things). The goal is to move beyond simple statements and begin to express the nuances of your daily life.

## 1. Reflexive Verbs (I Verbi Riflessivi)

### What are they and WHY do they exist?

This is a concept that can feel strange to native English speakers. In English, the subject of a verb performs an action on an object. For example, "I wash the car." The subject is "I," the action is "wash," and the object receiving the action is "the car."

But what if the action is directed back at the subject? In English, we use pronouns like "myself," "yourself," or "himself." For example, "I wash myself." Here, "I" am both the person doing the washing and the person being washed.

Italian takes this idea a step further. It has a specific category of verbs, called **reflexive verbs**, for these situations. You can think of them as "reflection" verbs—the action starts with the subject and reflects back onto them. They are a fundamental part of the language, used far more frequently and naturally than "-self" pronouns are in English.

They are easily identified because their infinitive (the basic form of the verb) ends in **-si**. For example:

*   `lavare` = to wash (something, like the car)
*   `lavar**si**` = to wash oneself

*   `svegliare` = to wake (someone else) up
*   `svegliar**si**` = to wake (oneself) up

### How to Use Them: Pronouns and Conjugation

To use a reflexive verb, you need two parts: a **reflexive pronoun** and the **conjugated verb**.

The reflexive pronoun comes **before** the verb and must match the subject.

| Subject Pronoun | Reflexive Pronoun | English Meaning |
| :-------------- | :---------------- | :-------------- |
| io              | **mi**            | myself          |
| tu              | **ti**            | yourself        |
| lui/lei/Lei     | **si**            | himself/herself/yourself (formal) |
| noi             | **ci**            | ourselves       |
| voi             | **vi**            | yourselves      |
| loro/Loro       | **si**            | themselves/yourselves (formal, pl.) |

The conjugation process is simple:
1.  Take the infinitive (e.g., `svegliarsi`).
2.  Drop the `-si` ending (`svegliar-`).
3.  Conjugate the remaining verb stem as you normally would for `-are`, `-ere`, or `-ire` verbs.
4.  Place the correct reflexive pronoun before the conjugated verb.

**Example: `alzarsi` (to get up / to raise oneself)**

| Pronoun | Reflexive Pronoun | Verb (`alzare`) | Full Conjugation      | Translation         |
| :------ | :---------------- | :-------------- | :-------------------- | :------------------ |
| io      | mi                | alzo            | **mi alzo**           | I get up            |
| tu      | ti                | alzi            | **ti alzi**           | You get up          |
| lui/lei | si                | alza            | **si alza**           | He/she gets up      |
| noi     | ci                | alziamo         | **ci alziamo**        | We get up           |
| voi     | vi                | alzate          | **vi alzate**         | You (all) get up    |
| loro    | si                | alzano          | **si alzano**         | They get up         |

## 2. Telling Time (Che ora è? / Che ore sono?)

In Italian, telling time is straightforward but has a few key rules.

**Asking the Time:**
*   `Che ora è?` - What time is it? (Singular)
*   `Che ore sono?` - What time is it? (Plural - more common)

**Stating the Time: The Basic Rule**

You use the verb `essere` (to be).
*   Use **`È...`** (It is...) for one o'clock, noon, and midnight.
*   Use **`Sono le...`** (They are the...) for all other hours.

Why the difference? Think of it as saying "It is the first hour" (singular) versus "They are the two hours" (plural). This is a core concept in Italian time-telling.

*   `È l'una.` (It's 1:00) - *l'una* is short for *l'una ora*.
*   `È mezzogiorno.` (It's noon.)
*   `È mezzanotte.` (It's midnight.)
*   `Sono le due.` (It's 2:00.)
*   `Sono le dieci.` (It's 10:00.)

**Adding Minutes:**

1.  **Past the hour (e):** Use `e` (and) for minutes 1-39.
    *   `Sono le tre **e dieci**.` (It's 3:10.)
    *   `Sono le otto **e venticinque**.` (It's 8:25.)

2.  **Quarter and Half Past:**
    *   `...e un quarto` (and a quarter) for 15 minutes past.
        *   `Sono le nove **e un quarto**.` (It's 9:15.)
    *   `...e mezza` (and a half) for 30 minutes past.
        *   `Sono le undici **e mezza**.` (It's 11:30.)

3.  **To the hour (meno):** Use `meno` (minus) for minutes 40-59. You state the **next** hour and subtract the minutes.
    *   `Sono le dieci **meno un quarto**.` (It's 9:45 - lit. "Ten minus a quarter")
    *   `Sono le sette **meno venti**.` (It's 6:40 - lit. "Seven minus twenty")
    *   `È l'una **meno dieci**.` (It's 12:50 - lit. "One minus ten")

**12-hour vs. 24-hour clock:** In casual conversation, Italians use the 12-hour clock. To specify morning or evening, you can add `di mattina` (in the morning), `del pomeriggio` (in the afternoon), or `di sera` (in the evening).
*   *Sono le otto di mattina.* (It's 8 AM.)
*   *Sono le otto di sera.* (It's 8 PM.)
In formal contexts (timetables, official announcements), the 24-hour clock is used: *Il treno parte alle 20:00 (venti)*.

## 3. Adverbs of Frequency (Avverbi di Frequenza)

These adverbs explain how often an action happens. Their placement in a sentence is important.

**The Adverbs (from most to least frequent):**
*   `sempre` - always
*   `spesso` - often
*   `di solito` - usually
*   `qualche volta` - sometimes
*   `raramente` - rarely
*   `non ... mai` - never

**Placement in the Sentence:**
In simple tenses like the present, the adverb is usually placed **directly after the verb**.

*   `Vado **spesso** al cinema.` (I often go to the cinema.)
*   `Lui si alza **sempre** tardi.` (He always gets up late.)
*   `Noi, **di solito**, ceniamo alle otto.` (*Di solito* can also start the sentence for emphasis.)

**The Special Case of `non ... mai` (never):**
Italian uses a double negative for "never." It's a rule you must follow. `non` comes **before** the verb, and `mai` comes **after** it. Think of it as a `non`/`mai` sandwich with the verb as the filling.

*   `**Non** bevo **mai** il caffè.` (I never drink coffee.)
*   `Lei **non** si trucca **mai**.` (She never puts on makeup.)
