## 1. Conditional Sentences Type 1 (Periodo Ipotetico del Primo Tipo)

Type 1 conditional sentences are used to express a real or highly probable condition and its consequence. They refer to situations that are likely to happen in the present or future.

*   **Structure:** `Se` + Present Indicative (condition) , Future Simple or Present Indicative (consequence)

### 1.1 Condition in the Present Indicative, Consequence in the Future Simple

This is the most common structure for Type 1 conditionals.

*   *Se **studi** (presente), **imparerai** (futuro) l'italiano.* (If you study, you will learn Italian.)
*   *Se **piove** (presente) domani, **non andremo** (futuro) al mare.* (If it rains tomorrow, we won't go to the beach.)
*   *Se **ho** (presente) tempo, **ti chiamerò** (futuro).* (If I have time, I will call you.)

### 1.2 Condition in the Present Indicative, Consequence in the Present Indicative

This structure is used when the consequence is a general truth, a habit, or an immediate result.

*   *Se **fa** (presente) freddo, **accendo** (presente) il riscaldamento.* (If it's cold, I turn on the heating.)
*   *Se **sei** (presente) stanco, **riposa** (presente).* (If you are tired, rest.)
*   *Se **non mangi** (presente), **hai** (presente) fame.* (If you don't eat, you are hungry.)

### 1.3 Position of the Clauses

The `se` clause (condition) and the main clause (consequence) can be swapped without changing the meaning.

*   *Imparerai l'italiano se studi.* (You will learn Italian if you study.)
*   *Non andremo al mare se piove domani.* (We won't go to the beach if it rains tomorrow.)

## 2. Expressing Opinions and Beliefs (Indicative Mood)

When expressing opinions, beliefs, or certainties, Italian generally uses the **indicative mood** in the subordinate clause, especially with verbs like *pensare* (to think), *credere* (to believe), *sapere* (to know), *dire* (to say), *essere sicuro/a* (to be sure), *sembrare* (to seem).

### 2.1 Common Phrases

*   **Penso che...** (I think that...)
    *   *Penso che **è** una buona idea.* (I think that it is a good idea.)
    *   *Penso che **verrà** domani.* (I think that he will come tomorrow.)

*   **Credo che...** (I believe that...)
    *   *Credo che **hanno ragione**.* (I believe that they are right.)
    *   *Credo che **sia** vero.* (I believe that it is true.) - *Note: While 'sia' is subjunctive, with 'credere' and 'pensare' when expressing certainty or a strong belief, the indicative is often used in informal speech. For formal or nuanced doubt, the subjunctive is preferred. For this unit, we focus on the indicative for certainty.*

*   **Secondo me...** (In my opinion... / According to me...)
    *   *Secondo me, **è** troppo caro.* (In my opinion, it's too expensive.)
    *   *Secondo me, **dovresti** studiare di più.* (In my opinion, you should study more.)

*   **Mi sembra che...** (It seems to me that...)
    *   *Mi sembra che **stai** bene.* (It seems to me that you are well.)

*   **Sono sicuro/a che...** (I am sure that...)
    *   *Sono sicuro che **parla** italiano bene.* (I am sure that he speaks Italian well.)

### 2.2 Review and Expansion of Piacere

We revisit *piacere* to express preferences and opinions about things.

*   *Mi piace **questo** film.* (I like this film.)
*   *Non mi piace **quando** piove.* (I don't like when it rains.)
*   *Ti piace **cucinare**?* (Do you like to cook?)
