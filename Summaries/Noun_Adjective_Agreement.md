# Grammar Summary: Noun-Adjective Agreement

In Italian, adjectives must agree in **gender** (masculine/feminine) and **number** (singular/plural) with the noun they describe. Adjectives usually come **after** the noun.

## Adjectives Ending in -O

These are the most common type. They have four forms:

|          | Singular | Plural |
| :------- | :------- | :----- |
| **Masc.**| -o       | -i     |
| **Fem.** | -a       | -e     |

**Examples:**

*   un libr**o** alt**o** (a tall book)
*   i libr**i** alt**i** (the tall books)
*   una cas**a** alt**a** (a tall house)
*   le cas**e** alt**e** (the tall houses)

*   il ragazz**o** italian**o** (the Italian boy)
*   la ragazz**a** italian**a** (the Italian girl)
*   i ragazz**i** italian**i** (the Italian boys)
*   le ragazz**e** italian**e** (the Italian girls)

## Adjectives Ending in -E

These adjectives have the same form for both masculine and feminine in the singular. They have only two forms:

|          | Singular | Plural |
| :------- | :------- | :----- |
| **Masc./Fem.** | -e       | -i     |

**Examples:**

*   un libr**o** interessant**e** (an interesting book)
*   una stori**a** interessant**e** (an interesting story)

*   i libr**i** interessant**i** (the interesting books)
*   le stori**e** interessant**i** (the interesting stories)

*   un esam**e** difficil**e** (a difficult exam)
*   i professor**i** gentil**i** (the kind professors)

## Invariable Adjectives

A few adjectives, often related to color, do not change at all. Common examples are `blu`, `rosa`, `viola`.

*   un vestito **blu** (a blue dress)
*   i vestiti **blu** (the blue dresses)
*   una macchina **rosa** (a pink car)
*   le macchine **rosa** (the pink cars)

---

## Position of Adjectives

*   **Usually AFTER the noun:** (color, shape, nationality, and most descriptive adjectives)
    *   *un gatto nero*, *una piazza grande*

*   **Can be placed BEFORE the noun:** (for common, subjective, or figurative adjectives like `bello`, `bravo`, `buono`, `nuovo`, `piccolo`, `grande`)
    *   *una **bella** giornata* (a beautiful day)
    *   *un **nuovo** amico* (a new friend)

**Note:** `bello` and `buono` have special forms when placed before the noun, which follow the pattern of definite/indefinite articles.
